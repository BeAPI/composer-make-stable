# Composer Make Stable

Make all of your composer's dependencies stable.

# What ?

Your dependencies into composer.json will be automatically be changed from :

`"wpackagist-plugin/wordpress-seo":"6.2"`

into :

`"wpackagist-plugin/wordpress-seo":"*@stable"`

This command is useful especially during an audit. It allows you to grab latest versions of your requirements.
Once your audit is finished it's recommended to use another command : [Freeze version](https://github.com/BeAPI/composer-freeze-version) to keep versions you have tested.

## 1 [Composer](http://composer.rarst.net/)

- Add repository source : `{ "type": "vcs", "url": "https://github.com/BeAPI/composer-make-stable" }`.
- Include `"bea/composer/make-stable": "dev-master"` in your composer file as require-dev.

## 2 Run command
Then you can simply launch `composer make-stable` !
